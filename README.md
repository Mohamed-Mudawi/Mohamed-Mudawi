# About Me:
My name is Ashraful Mahin, I'm a Computer Science student at Hunter College with a minor in Economics. I'm passionate about technology and finance, with a particular interest in financial markets and their technological infrastructure. Currently, I'm a software engineer intern at Cognizant Technology Solutions and an incoming Software Engineer Intern at JP Morgan. My previous experiences include roles as a Technical Product Manager at Develop for Good and a previous software engineering internship at CUNY BMCC.

I'm a 6x hackathon winner, with notable achievements at prestigious competitions including Columbia DivHacks and BostonHacks.

I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow!
